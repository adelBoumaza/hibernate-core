= TODO for Steve for 6.0 work

* Consolidate `org.hibernate.query.criteria.LiteralHandlingMode` and `org.hibernate.query.QueryLiteralRendering`
* (?) Move output parameter value access from `org.hibernate.procedure.ProcedureOutputs` up to `org.hibernate.result.Outputs` (?)
* Currently, while processing mappings, unqualified entity names are qualified via HQL imports - that seems wrong, seems like it ought to be "mapping scope"-based
